# RayCasting
This is a Ray Casting Rendering With Map Drawing you can walk and rotate with the arrows 

To Draw the map, you can draw it While it's running on the 2D Map on the left Side of the screen by left clicking to add a Cube and right clicking to remove one or you could put a Cube with a different color by using the middle button.
You could also initialize the map in the code by changing the Array Map, a 1 means a wall, a 0 means nothing<br />
<pre>
Map = [ [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
</pre>

You could also make the map bigger by changing the Grid_Size by a power of 2 for example Grid_Size = 16 instead of 32 but dont forget to change the start position so the player don't start on a wall

now you can make your map bigger for example:
<pre>
Map = [ [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
        [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]
</pre>
this is not the full map off course you coud do up to 32x32 with a grid size of  16
dependencies:
numpy
pygame
